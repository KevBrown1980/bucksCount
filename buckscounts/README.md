# Buckscounts
**GOAL**: We’re counting Starbucks Locations by city today! We’ll use flexbox and other properties to style up our pre-existing HTML and make it look Starbucks-ish. Take what we have provided in the repo and, using the selectors we’ve learned along with flexbox, transform it to the goal provided.
